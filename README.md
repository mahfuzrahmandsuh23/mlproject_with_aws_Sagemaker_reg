## ðŸ§  SageMaker Linear Regression Model with Real-Time Inference

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a linear regression model using **Amazon SageMaker**. It uses SageMakerâ€™s built-in **Linear Learner algorithm** to predict numerical outcomes based on input features.

### ðŸ”§ Features

* End-to-end ML workflow in **SageMaker Studio**
* Training with built-in **Linear Learner** algorithm
* Real-time deployment to a **SageMaker endpoint**
* Live predictions using `boto3` and JSON input
* Fully managed and scalable infrastructure

### ðŸš€ Workflow

1. Prepare and upload training data to S3
2. Define and train the Linear Learner model
3. Deploy the model to a real-time endpoint
4. Invoke the endpoint to get predictions
5. Clean up resources to avoid costs

### ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

* **Amazon SageMaker (Studio & SDK)**
* **S3** for data storage
* **Python** with `boto3` and `numpy`
